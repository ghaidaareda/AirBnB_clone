# Project: 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

![Airbnb](https://peytonbrsmith.netlify.app/projects/web/airbnb/65f4a1dd9c51265f49d0_hu98d6ceda137062fd4edf4a7d705e7570_76537_700x0_resize_box_3.png)

This project is the first step towards building a full web application: the **AirBnB clone**. 

It is very important because it serves as the back-end base of other projects: 
HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

## The Console

![console](https://peytonbrsmith.netlify.app/projects/web/airbnb/815046647d23428a14ca_hu68774d5216c48b4f424f088e55e7a2ed_118703_700x0_resize_box_3.png)

This software is a command interpreter similar to a Linux shell but limited to a specific use-case; management of objects in the AirBnB Clone:

-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object
-   manage (create, update, destroy, read) objects via a console / command interpreter
-  store and persists objects to a file (JSON file)

## Usage

**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.
